Version 1.4

 . Skip newline when reading in klog messages
 . Use lseek64() instead of llseek() which is deprecated these days
 . Close symbol file before returning with 0 when an error occurred
   while reading it.  This will enable systems to umount that
   partition with no open file descriptor left over.

   - printline() fixes
 . Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@debian.org>
   - printchopped() fix
 . Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>
   - Fixed bug that caused klogd to die if there is no sym_array available.
   - When symbols are expanded, print the line twice.  Once with
     addresses converted to symbols, once with the raw text.  Allows
     external programs such as ksymoops do their own processing on the
     original data.
 . Several bugfixes and improvements, please refer to the .c files
